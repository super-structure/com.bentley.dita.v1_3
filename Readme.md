# Bentley DITA V1.3 DocTypes

2019-09-18

This plug-in contains DTDs for Bentley's specializations of DITA v1.3 topics and maps. These are only shells and custom domains. 

## Notes
* The Math domain used in previous versions was refactored to the OASIS DITA v1.3 Equation domain. The MathML domain was edited to use "mml" as the namespace
* The Rhetoric domain was removed and the em element moved to the Highlighting domain.
* Specialized topic types faq and verification were moved into the TechnicalContent folder (along with the DITA v1.3 troubleshooting topic)
* The filenames prefixes of "bentley_" were removed.

## To Do:

* Create XSDs using URLs  - copy Schema files & just do grep find/replace for System URIs - URL
